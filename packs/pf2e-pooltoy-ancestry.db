{"name":"Pooltoy","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-pooltoy/assets/pooltoy.svg","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Whether the creations of eccentric caster or a person cursed to become one, pooltoys are unusual elementals with an inner power.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pooltoys are elemental creatures, a spirit inhabiting a body of thin skin. They were originally made by an eccentric wizard who wanted a companion to aid them in swimming, creating an amalgamated elemental spirit of water and air and giving it a magically created skin it could inhabit. Pooltoys are often lazy, preferring to float around in their preferred environment and help others relax with them. Though some may see the world with wide eyes and wish to see more, especially if that gives one more scenic vistas to see while relaxing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The creation ritual, however, was imperfect and often left pooltoys with the ability to transform others into one of them by a curse. The curse not only changes the body, but turns the soul into an elemental spirit, making it difficult to break should it take hold completely. </p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">You might…</h3>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Be curious about the lives of people living in the material plane.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Try to relax and take it easy even when things are stressful.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seek information about curses and how to break them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Others probably…</h3>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Look upon you with curiosity.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ask to feel or squish your body.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Find your clumsy movement delightful.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Physical Description</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pooltoys are a hollow skin, which is given shape by their elemental spirit within, typically filling them with air. The patterns and color of this skin vary wildly, from bright colors, to muted earth tones. Their skin can be fully transparent or completely opaque and everything in-between. The shape of pooltoys can also vary, but they commonly take on a humanoid form that typically appear to be stylized and simplified animals, with stocky, round limbs. Pooltoys are very rounded in general, since their shape is formed from their spirit filling their skin with air.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their skin feels completely smooth and is often shiny, whether transparent or opaque. A healthy pooltoy’s skin tends to feel taut and cool when touched. Verdant pooltoys, however, have a more somewhat rougher or slightly slimy feeling to their skin, since it’s formed of algae and plant matter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A pooltoy's face appears flush against their body, looking to be just a painted image of a face. Their faces are typically capable of animating to show different emotions. Some pooltoys, however, may have a completely static face and, very rarely, might not even have a face at all. Neither impacts their senses or ability to speak, though.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being elementals, pooltoys don’t need to breathe as their breath comes from their favored elemental plane through their spirit. They also don’t need to eat, but their skin needs to be moistened every so often with water to not become brittle and crumble. A pooltoy’s mind still requires sleep, however. A pooltoy lives around 200 years on average. Their skin becomes stiffer and dryer towards the end of their natural life.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Society</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pooltoys are not interested in forming societies of their own, often traveling and seeing the world for their own reasons rather than settling down with others of their kind. However, most all natural pooltoys like to take things easy and slowly, enjoying frequent moments of relaxation, often inviting others to join them. Floating in water is an especially common form of relaxation for pooltoys, both being a peaceful activity while also nourishing their skin. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pooltoys with connections to other planes may also enjoy relaxing around their favored element instead - fires for smokey pooltoys or mud pits for dusty pooltoys, though both still require water all the same to keep their skin healthy. This desire for relaxation is what causes curse-laden pooltoys to try and transform others, seeing other’s anxieties as something that can be fixed by having a new form.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Alignment and Religion</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being elementals, pooltoys have a strong reverence for deities regarding the elements, the most commonly worshiped deity being Gozreh. Though deities of fire or earth may also be worshiped by smokey and dusty pooltoys.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The nature of the elements is chaotic, which tend to make pooltoys more chaotic than most.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Adventurers</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to their elemental spirit, pooltoys have an innate knack for magic. Sorcerers, kineticists, and oracles are a common class among pooltoys as magic and elemental manipulation comes naturally to them, with verdant pooltoys often becoming druids. Martial classes don’t tend to be common among pooltoys, but that doesn’t stop some from becoming champions to elemental-aligned deities, monks, or rangers. Cursed pooltoys may become thaumaturges as their pursuit to study or break their curse may lead them down a path of superstition.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Names</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pooltoys tend to name themselves after geographical features, weather, or other phenomena related to the element their inner spirit is strongly connected with. Pooltoys who engage with the cultures of others may take on a name of that culture instead, while cursed pooltoys are likely to keep whatever name they had before they were cursed.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Names</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coast, Current, Ember, Quake, Storm, Tailwind, Wave</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Pooltoy Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points </strong>10</p>\n<p><strong>Size </strong>Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed </strong>20 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts </strong>Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw </strong>Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages </strong>Common, Auran</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it’s positive) Choose from Abyssal, Aquan, Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, Terran, and other languages to which you may have access to (such as languages available to your original ancestry, if you are a cursed pooltoy).</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Soul </strong>Your spirit is raw elemental essence contained in an inflatable body.
